*** IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ***

For this device, bout number is defined as the number of times the photobeam was interrupted
Bout duration is the amount of time the beam was broken. 
Data were collected in 1-min increments.


Lick number is defined as the number of times the animal licked the sipper, 
while lick duration is defined as the actual contact time on the sipper.



Importing modified data set
```{r}
library(readr)
# Directory for my laptop
Mouse1 <- read_csv("LIQHD_Mouse1.csv")


##### SETTING UP THE DATA #####

# Directory for LAB PC
Mouse1 <- read_csv("LIQHD_Mouse1.csv")
View(Mouse1)

# IMPORTING OG DATA
LIQ_HD_240719 <- read_csv("LIQ HD 7.19.24 (1).csv")

# Adding millis column to Mouse1 data from OG data
Mouse1 %>%
  mutate(millis = LIQ_HD_240719$millis) -> Mouse1

Mouse1 %>%
  select(DateTime, Time, ExperimentalSide, millis, everything()) -> Mouse1

# Turning DateTime into date type variable
Mouse1 %>% 
  mutate(DateTime = ymd_hms(DateTime)) -> Mouse1

```
Making the graph/plots for the data. Goal is to replicate the number of licks over time graph made in LIQ-HD Software. Also make a graph plotting preference percentage.

**Check out dbplot package

```{r}
library(dbplot)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

Example Raster Plot

```{r}

# Returns a 100x100 raster plot of record count of intersections of eruptions and waiting

faithful %>% dbplot_raster(eruptions, waiting)


# Returns a 50x50 raster plot of eruption averages of intersections of eruptions and waiting 

faithful %>% dbplot_raster(eruptions, waiting, fill = mean(eruptions), resolution = 50)
View(faithful)


# Returns a 100x100 grid of record count of intersections of eruptions and waiting 

faithful %>% db_compute_raster(eruptions, waiting) 

# Returns a 50x50 grid of eruption averages of intersections of eruptions and waiting 

faithful %>% db_compute_raster2(eruptions, waiting, fill = mean(eruptions), resolution = 50)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
